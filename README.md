# Portfolio Project: Predicting Start-up Valuation

## Project Overview

As a data scientist hired by a company investing in start-ups, the objective is to determine whether it's possible to predict whether a start-up will reach a valuation over 5 billion based on various characteristics such as its country of origin, category, and details about its investors. The project aims to test the feasibility of such predictions and assess the confidence level in the results.
